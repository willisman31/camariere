# camariere

Simple Java server built from scratch; not for production environments.

## Getting Started

The current implementation allows you to serve static files over unencrypted HTTP.  To get started, simply replace the static files in the /static directory with your own.  Logs are output to the /logs directory in the format of "camariere-year-month-day.log".
