# camariere

Simple Java server built from scratch; not for production environments.

## Getting Started

The current implementation allows you to serve static files over unencrypted
HTTP.  To get started, simply replace the static files in the /static directory
with your own.  Logs are output to the /logs directory in the format of
"camariere-year-month-day.log".

## Build

To build the artifacts for the Server, run the following build script:

`./build.sh`

To clean up (i.e. remove) the built artifacts, run the following:

`./build.sh clean`

## Configuration
